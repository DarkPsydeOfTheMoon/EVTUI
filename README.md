# EVTUI

*A WIP tool for viewing, editing, and creating story events in P5R.*

## Setup

For basically any command-line interface, cloning and entering the repository directory should work the same way:

```
git clone https://github.com/DarkPsydeOfTheMoon/EVTUI.git
cd EVTUI
```

Then, assuming you've cloned and are within the repository's local directory, run the setup script for your current OS:

### Windows

The command prompt and similar interfaces should work with this syntax:

```
.\scripts\bootstrap_win.bat
```

...but if you're using a tool like Git Bash, the slashes may be reversed (i.e., Unix-style):

```
./scripts/bootstrap_win.bat
```

### Debian Linux

```
./scripts/bootstrap_debian.sh
```

### Fedora-based Linux

```
./scripts/bootstrap_fedora.sh
```

(Credit to [theloneraven](https://github.com/theloneraven) for getting this setup working.)

### Other Linux

TBD.

## Building

Although this project is a WIP and has no official release, you can see the current state by building a standalone executable of the project in `src/gui/` for your target OS like so (or just `build` and `run` like any .NET Core application):

### Windows

```
dotnet publish --runtime win-x86
```

### Linux

```
dotnet publish --runtime linux-x64
```

### Acknowledgments

The `Serialization` library is a port of the excellent [exbip](https://github.com/Pherakki/exbip-python) (License: MIT) Python library â€” both original and port by [Pherakki](https://github.com/Pherakki).

The ACB parsing code from [LazyBone152](https://github.com/LazyBone152)'s [XV2-Tools](https://github.com/LazyBone152/XV2-Tools) (License: MIT) was originally included as a patched module, but this dependency has since been deprecated. Even so, the current ACB code was heavily based on it. The same is true of the ADX parsing/decrypting from [Thealexbarney](https://github.com/Thealexbarney)'s [VGAudio](https://github.com/Thealexbarney/VGAudio) (License: MIT).

Although [TGE](https://github.com/tge-was-taken)'s [EvtTool](https://github.com/tge-was-taken/EvtTool) (especially the contributions by [Secre-C](https://github.com/Secre-C)) is not explicitly used in this project, it was *heavily* referenced for the EVT-parsing functionality.

[Rirurin](https://github.com/rirurin)'s [scripts](https://github.com/rirurin/persona5-june2014) (License: MIT) to access the June 2014 P5 beta debug menu were instrumental in parsing and UI-ifying EVTs and all of the commands within them. Additionally, the implementation for ENV-related commands is highly informed by the work of [bladekey88](https://github.com/bladekey88).

Finally, this tool would be a broken mess (especially on Windows, but also in general) without the diligent testing of [CroissantGuard](https://github.com/CroissantGuard).
